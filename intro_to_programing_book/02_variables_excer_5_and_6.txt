# Exercise 5

The first program will work and out put the number 3

the second program will give the following error:

NameError: undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object
  from (irb):6
  from /Users/macuser/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/bin/irb:15:in `<main>'

  It is giving the above error because x was used within the do/end block but it hadn't been defined outside of the block. 

  # Exercise 6

  a mistake similar to the one above was made in that "shoes" might have been used in a block but not defined outside of the block.
